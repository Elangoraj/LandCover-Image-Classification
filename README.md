Dataset(EuroSat)
  1.	Eurostat data taken from Sentinel-2 satellite(http://madm.dfki.de/downloads).
  2.	The original data is multispectral consist of 13 spectral bands is being reduced to RGB color space for analysis.
  3.	Further, the dataset consists of 10 different landcover class AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, and SeaLake. 
  4.	There are in total of 27000 images of size 64*64 within the dataset. 
  5.	Classes are not perfectly balanced yet images of multiple classes are similarly distributed.
